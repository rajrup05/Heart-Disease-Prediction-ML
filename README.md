# Heart-Disease-Prediction-ML
Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data/data

This project focuses on building and evaluating a machine learning-based classification system
using medical indicators. The primary objective is to accurately classify patients as having
"Disease" or "No Disease" while addressing challenges such as missing values, categorical
feature encoding, and feature scaling. The workflow begins with data loading and
preprocessing, where categorical variables like chest pain type and thalassemia are
transformed using One-Hot Encoding. A Random Forest Classifier is trained and evaluated
using a confusion matrix to assess True Positives and False Negatives. The results
demonstrate that the model achieves strong performance, successfully identifying the majority
of positive heart disease cases, and is integrated into a user-friendly prediction function that
offers specific medical advice.
